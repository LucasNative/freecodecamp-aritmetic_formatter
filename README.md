## Aritmetic Formatter

#### This project is part of [**Scientific Computing with Python Projects**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/portuguese/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) by *Free Code Camp*

I developed this function that receives a list of arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.
`print(arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"]))`

Optionally receives a second parameter **True** for show de result.
`print(arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"], True))`

Output:

For your convinience i let a example in de source code. Feel free to clone and use with your arithmetic problems!
